# Hostel Application Form Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Duplicate Sections

**Removed: Personal Information Section**
- Gender field (already in user profile)
- Academic Level field (calculated from admission year)

**Removed: Emergency Contact Information Section**
- Emergency contact name
- Emergency contact relationship
- Emergency contact phone
- Emergency contact email

**Reason:** These fields are redundant as:
- Student's personal information (gender, level) is already stored in the user profile
- Guardian/Parent information (phone numbers and relationships) is already in the user profile
- The application form now uses this existing data instead of collecting it again

### 2. Added New Field

**Added: Hostel Gender Preference**
- Location: Under the "Hostel Preferences" section
- Options:
  - Same Gender: Hostel with only the student's gender
  - Mixed Gender: Co-educational hostel
- Default: Automatically set to "Same Gender" when form loads
- Behavior: Dynamically filters available hostels based on preference

### 3. Updated Form Logic

**Frontend Changes (`src/routes/dashboard/apply/+page.svelte`):**
- Added `loadUserProfile()` function to fetch user data on mount
- Removed `formData.gender` and `formData.level` from form state
- Removed `formData.emergencyContact` object from form state
- Added `formData.hostelGenderPreference` field
- Updated hostel loading logic to filter by hostel gender preference
- Reactive statement updates available hostels when preference changes
- Removed validation for gender, level, and emergency contact fields
- Added validation for hostelGenderPreference field
- Submit function now includes user's gender from profile

**Backend Changes (`src/routes/api/applications/+server.ts`):**
- Removed emergency contact validation
- Added hostelGenderPreference validation
- Updated hostel filtering logic:
  - If "SAME_GENDER" selected: Filters hostels by user's gender (MALE/FEMALE)
  - If "MIXED" selected: Filters hostels by MIXED gender type
- Improved error messages for hostel validation

### 4. Benefits

**User Experience:**
- Shorter, simpler application form
- No redundant data entry
- Clearer purpose of each field
- Better data consistency

**Data Integrity:**
- Single source of truth for personal information
- Guardian/emergency contact info maintained in one place
- Reduced chance of data discrepancies

**Form Flow:**
1. Student completes profile settings with personal info and guardian details
2. Student applies for hostel with preferences only
3. System uses existing profile data for application

## Testing

### To Test the Changes:

1. **Ensure Profile is Complete:**
   - Visit `/dashboard/settings`
   - Fill in: Gender, Date of Birth, Guardian Phone Numbers, Guardian Relationships
   - Save profile

2. **Test Application Form:**
   - Visit `/dashboard/apply`
   - Verify form loads with user profile data
   - Select "Hostel Gender Preference" (Same Gender or Mixed)
   - Notice available hostels update based on preference
   - Select hostel preferences (1st, 2nd, 3rd choice)
   - Fill optional fields (special needs, medical conditions, roommate request)
   - Accept declaration
   - Submit application

3. **Verify Data Flow:**
   - Check application uses correct gender from profile
   - Check level is calculated from admission year
   - Check application doesn't require emergency contact

## Files Modified

1. `/src/routes/dashboard/apply/+page.svelte`
   - Removed Personal Information section UI
   - Removed Emergency Contact section UI
   - Added Hostel Gender Preference dropdown
   - Updated form state and validation logic
   - Added user profile loading

2. `/src/routes/api/applications/+server.ts`
   - Removed emergency contact validation
   - Added hostel gender preference handling
   - Updated hostel filtering logic based on preference

## Database Impact

**No schema changes required.** The application continues to use the existing schema:
- User profile already has gender, admission year, guardian phones, relationships
- Application model uses gender and level fields as before
- Emergency contact was never stored separately (guardian info is sufficient)

## Future Considerations

If emergency contact needs to be different from guardian:
- Could add optional "Different Emergency Contact" checkbox
- Would allow override only when necessary
- Would default to using guardian information

If mixed-gender hostel support needs expansion:
- Could add more granular preferences
- Could allow "Any Gender" option
- Could add preference weighting system
