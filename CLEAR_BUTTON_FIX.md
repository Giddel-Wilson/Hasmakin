# Clear Button Fix for Hostel Preferences

## Problem
The first hostel preference dropdown couldn't be cleared. Only the 2nd and 3rd preferences had the X (clear) button visible.

## Root Cause
The clear button visibility was controlled by this condition:
```svelte
{#if preference && index > 0}
```

This meant:
- ✅ 2nd preference (index 1): Shows X button if selected
- ✅ 3rd preference (index 2): Shows X button if selected  
- ❌ 1st preference (index 0): Never shows X button (because index > 0 is false)

## Solution
Changed the condition to show the clear button for ANY preference that has a value:
```svelte
{#if preference}
  <button 
    type="button"
    on:click={() => removePreference(index)}
    class="text-red-500 hover:text-red-700 transition-colors"
    aria-label="Clear selection"
    title="Clear this preference"
  >
    <svg class="w-5 h-5" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
      <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path>
    </svg>
  </button>
{:else}
  <!-- Placeholder to maintain spacing when no X button -->
  <div class="w-5 h-5"></div>
{/if}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Condition
- **Before:** `{#if preference && index > 0}`
- **After:** `{#if preference}`

### 2. Added Placeholder
Added an invisible placeholder div when no X button is shown to maintain consistent spacing:
```svelte
{:else}
  <div class="w-5 h-5"></div>
{/if}
```

### 3. Improved Accessibility
- Added `aria-label="Clear selection"` for screen readers
- Added `title="Clear this preference"` for tooltip
- Added `transition-colors` for smooth hover effect

## Result

### Before
```
[1] [Alvan Ikoku Hall ▼]                    (no X button)
[2] [Professor Dike Hall ▼] [X]             (has X button)
[3] [Select a hostel... ▼]                  (no X button - nothing selected)
```

### After
```
[1] [Alvan Ikoku Hall ▼] [X]                (now has X button!)
[2] [Professor Dike Hall ▼] [X]             (has X button)
[3] [Select a hostel... ▼] [ ]              (placeholder for alignment)
```

## Behavior

Now all three preference dropdowns work the same way:
- When a hostel is selected → X button appears
- Click X → Selection is cleared
- When no hostel is selected → Placeholder maintains spacing

## Files Modified
- `/src/routes/dashboard/apply/+page.svelte`

## Testing
1. Select a hostel in the 1st preference dropdown
2. X button appears next to it
3. Click the X button
4. Selection is cleared back to "Select a hostel..."
5. X button disappears (replaced with placeholder space)

Works for all three preference dropdowns!
