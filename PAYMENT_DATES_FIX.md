# Payment Period Configuration Fix

## Problem
Students were seeing "Payment Period Closed" modal even though they should be able to make payments. This was because:

1. Payment start date was set
2. Payment deadline was set to a time in the PAST (October 12, 2025 at 01:45 AM)
3. Current time is past the deadline, so system correctly shows "closed"

## Solution
Updated payment dates to open the payment period:
- **Payment Start Date**: October 10, 2025, 12:00:00 AM (same as applications)
- **Payment Deadline**: October 20, 2025, 11:59:00 PM (extended beyond application deadline)

## How to Manage Payment Dates

### For Admins:
1. Go to **Admin Dashboard** â†’ **Settings** tab
2. Look for **System Configuration** section
3. Update these fields:
   - **Payment Start Date**: When students can start paying
   - **Payment Deadline**: Last date for payments
4. Click **Save Settings**

### Recommended Configuration:
```
Application Period:  Oct 9 - Oct 15
Payment Period:      Oct 10 - Oct 20  (slightly after applications)
Allocation Period:   Oct 21 - Oct 30  (after payments)
```

## Quick Scripts

### Check Current Payment Dates:
```bash
bun check-payment-dates.ts
```

### Open Payment Period Now:
```bash
bun open-payments-now.ts
```

## Payment Flow Logic

The system checks payment period status as follows:

1. **Not Started**: If payment start date not reached OR not set
2. **Open**: If current time is between start date and deadline
3. **Closed**: If current time is past the deadline

## Files Modified
- `open-payments-now.ts` - Script to set payment dates
- `check-payment-dates.ts` - Script to check current settings

## Testing
1. Refresh student payment page
2. Modal should NOT appear
3. "Make Payment" button should work
4. System will redirect to demo payment page (or Paystack if configured)

## Note
Just like application dates, payment dates can be managed through the admin settings page. Administrators should set these dates appropriately for each academic session.
