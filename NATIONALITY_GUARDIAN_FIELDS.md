### Sample User Data (Giddel Wilson):
```json
{
  "name": "Giddel Wilson",
  "email": "gogbonna004@uniport.edu.ng",
  "gender": "MALE",
  "nationality": "Nigeria",
  "state_of_origin": "Imo",
  "religion": "Christianity",
  "phone_number": "+2348061403424",
  "guardian_phone_1": "+2348033415673",
  "guardian_relationship_1": "Father",
  "guardian_phone_2": "+2348033414744",
  "guardian_relationship_2": "Mother"
}
```

### Verification Commands:
```bash
# Check user data
bun run check-user.ts

# Update new fields with test data
bun run update-new-fields.ts

# Inspect full database
bun run inspect-database.ts
```

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **User selects Nationality** → State/Province dropdown updates with relevant options
2. **State dropdown is disabled** until nationality is selected
3. **When nationality changes** → State field resets to empty
4. **Guardian relationships** → Dropdown selection for each guardian phone number
5. **All fields are optional** except Gender (marked with *)

## 🚀 Production Ready
