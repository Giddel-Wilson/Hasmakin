# Application Submission Token Expiration Fix

## Problem
Student application submission fails with error: **"Invalid authentication token"**

## Root Cause
JWT access token has expired after 15-60 minutes of inactivity.

## Solution
Added automatic token refresh and retry logic to the application submission:

### What Changed
**File:** `/src/routes/dashboard/apply/+page.svelte`

Now when submission gets a 401 error:
1. âœ… Automatically attempts to refresh the token
2. âœ… Retries the submission if refresh succeeds
3. âœ… Shows clear error message if refresh fails
4. âœ… Redirects to login page after 2 seconds

### Code Logic
```typescript
if (response.status === 401) {
  // Try to refresh tokens
  const refreshed = await ClientAuth.refreshTokens();
  if (refreshed) {
    // Retry submission
    return submitApplication();
  } else {
    // Show error and redirect to login
    errors.submit = 'Your session has expired. Please log in again.';
    setTimeout(() => goto('/auth/login'), 2000);
  }
}
```

## For the Current Student

**To fix the error you're seeing right now:**

### Option 1: Just Refresh the Page
1. Press `Cmd + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + R` (Windows)
2. Try submitting the application again
3. Should work now!

### Option 2: Log Out & Log In Again
1. Click "Logout" in the top right
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Go back to the application form
4. Submit your application

## Result
âœ… Students can now submit applications even if their session has expired  
âœ… Automatic token refresh happens behind the scenes  
âœ… Clear error messages if refresh fails  
âœ… Seamless user experience  

The application will now handle expired tokens gracefully! ðŸŽ‰
